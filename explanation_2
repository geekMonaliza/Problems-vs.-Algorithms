The list is rotated sorted list, I used binary search and did some modification in binary search algorithm.
Because left or right of the mid is always sorted, I added check statement (if)s to detect which part of is sorted and
in which part the number is located and recur accordingly

Time and space efficiency is like binary search:
Time = O(log(n))
space = O(1)
