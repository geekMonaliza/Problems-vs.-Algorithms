Because input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2. if put the 0s and 2s in the correct positions,
this will automatically cause the 1s to be in the correct positions.

The array is sorted by a single pass:
Time = O(n)

We did in place sort, we didn't use additional space while sorting.
Space = O(1)
