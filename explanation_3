Because array elements are in the range [0, 9], I applied count sort algorithm to sort the arr and distributed
the sorted digits to two numbers.

Count sort algorithm generates a sorted array by a single pass of input list, but used additional space to save
counts array which has number of digits a number can have, in our case it's in range [0, 9], so it will be always
of size 10.

Time = O(n)
Space = O(1)
