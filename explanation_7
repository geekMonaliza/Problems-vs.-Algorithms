To implementHTTPRouter using a Trie data structure, I filled the required methods to return handler for each route.
we have three main functionality:
   1. convert path to array of it elements between "/"
   2. add route handler for path elements
   3. look up for route handler of path elements

Trie can have depth containing the number of elements between "/":
Time = O(n)
Space = O(n)
