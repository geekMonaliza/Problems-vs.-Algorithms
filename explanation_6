I set the first element of the unsorted array to be initial min and max, then passed each element of input compared with that initial value
and selected the smaller for min and the larger for max.

I could find min and max of the unsorted array in a single traversal:
Time = O(n)

I didn't use additional space to find min, max
Space = O(1)
